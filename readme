Hello NSG wizards!
I'm enclosing here the functions and files we will need to set up for the automated update of EEGLAB on NSG. Let me go quickly over what we should do.
 First, we need to create a clean copy of EEGLAB. For this, we will clone the EEGLAB repo in GitHub. For this, I'm providing here the shell script mk_eeglab_clean_copy_wplugins.sh. Before executing this script, we must update the path to MATLAB and the path to the folder where we want EEGLAB installed. I've indicated this with comments in the script. EEGLAB plugin installation is carried out in this script as well. For this, I'm invoking the Matlab script eeglab_install_plugins.m. After running this script we should have a clean EEGLAB copy with all the plug-ins we deemed convenient to add. Once a new EEGLAB version is out, we just need to update the tag in line 17 (git checkout tags/2020.0) for the new tag.
We need to set up a crontab to automatically execute two functionalities. One for updating EEGLAB and another for updating the plugins for which there is an available update. The code for the crontab is in the file crontab_update_eeglab.txt. Here again, we must update the path to the file  update_eeglab_in_nsg.sh  and the path to MATLAB in the system in COMET. The path to the EEGLAB folder should be also updated in the script update_eeglab_in_nsg.sh .
I've tested this in my environment and seems to work. However, it is key to update the paths to the files and MATLAB.
Please let me know if you guys have any questions.
